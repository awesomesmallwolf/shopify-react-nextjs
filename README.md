## Experience

* Using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of React.Component to create stateful components.
* Using [Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-starter-kit) to do more work with less code.
* Making [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) working with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) with [withRedux.tsx](https://github.com/Maxvien/next-shopify-storefront/blob/master/hocs/withRedux.tsx) higher order component.
* Using `react-redux` [hooks](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks) instead of `react-redux` [connect](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect) to read and update the store's state.
* Using TypeScript static types for Component Props, Reducers, Actions & Services.
* Using [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to generate models for TypeScript.
* Working with GraphQL tags faster with [Apollo GraphQL for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) extension.
* Making [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/get-started/) working with NextJS including server side and client side.
* Working with [Shopify Storefront GraphQL API](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/storefront-api/getting-started).
* Making [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) working with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) with [withMui.tsx](https://github.com/Maxvien/next-shopify-storefront/blob/master/hocs/withMui.tsx) higher order component.
* Configuring [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to lint and format the source code.
* Deploying NodeJS applications on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
